<div class="mar"></div>

<p>Welcome to my page created using Angular2! I use an API of Netflix, and in the example links show movies of Quentin Tarantino:</p>

<li><span>Director link</span>: movies in which he is the director.</li>
<li><span>Actor link</span>: movies in which he is an actor.</li>

<p>In the <span>Main link</span>, you can search any actor and see his movies. </p>
